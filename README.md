# Deep-Symbolic-Networks
Development of the [Deep Symbolic Networks (DSN) model](https://github.com/qunzhi/Deep-Symbolic-Networks/raw/master/workingpaper/main_DSN.pdf) towards the dream of strong AI

Key insights:
1. intelligence is an emergent phenomenon of the complex world, which has a deep, hierarchical structure
2. physical things are mapped to symbols in human brains by coarse-graining, so the real world is mapped to a deep symbolic network
3. symbols and their combinations sharing common features will produce new symbols, such as more abstract concepts
5. symbols are separated by singularities, so it is possible to learn a deep symbolic network by adaptive learning; i.e., unsupervised learning and self correcting adaptive to the outside world
4. knowledge can be represented by the symbols and their links, which can be used to adapt to or modify the outside world
5. natural languages are the means of humans communicating knowledge encoded in deep symbolic networks, such as definitions of things or concepts, changing states of physical things, processes, and much more

List of things to do:
1. DSN can be seen as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), if one uses neural networks to identify symbols. It is thus possible to find symbols and links from DNN results by visualizing them.
2. It might be possible to add prior and posterior probabilities to the symbols in DNN results. If it can work, the results can be used to do Bayesian inference, thus useful for applications in specific domains
3. unsupervised learning algorithm development started from the MNIST database
